# HirePilot Overview

## Who this is for
Anyone using HirePilot — new users, existing customers, support staff, or prospects — who needs a clear, conceptual understanding of what HirePilot is and how it works.

## TL;DR
- HirePilot is a **full Recruiting CRM + ATS** powered by **AI agents (REX)**.
- It replaces dozens of tools: spreadsheets, Monday.com, Apollo, Zapier, Typeform, Yesware, Hunter, PhantomBuster, etc.
- Users can source leads/clients, manage candidates, run outreach, automate follow-ups, scrape LinkedIn & Sales Navigator, manage job requisitions, run Deals + Billing, and build custom tables/dashboards.
- The platform is built to support **full-cycle recruiting** — from finding clients → launching campaigns → sourcing candidates → managing pipelines → invoicing.

## What HirePilot Actually Is
HirePilot is a unified AI-powered recruiting platform combining four previously separate systems:

1. **Recruiting CRM**  
   Manage clients, leads, outreach, nurturing, follow-up, and deals.

2. **ATS (Applicant Tracking System)**  
   Track job requisitions, candidates, pipelines, stages, submissions, and placements.

3. **AI Agent System (REX)**  
   Your personal recruiting co-pilot that:
   - Sources leads
   - Writes outreach
   - Schedules tasks
   - Enriches data
   - Pulls LinkedIn/SalesNav profiles
   - Sends messages
   - Runs workflows
   - Automates sourcing campaigns
   - And soon: runs its own weekly prospecting cycles

4. **Automation Hub**  
   Connect HirePilot to Zapier, Make, Slack, email providers, and LinkedIn sessions for safe automation.

Together, these components eliminate the need for a complicated stack and bring everything into one system.

## How HirePilot Replaces the Old Stack

### Without HirePilot
Recruiters typically use:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Spreadsheets | Leads, candidates, job tracking |
| Monday/Notion | CRM + pipelines |
| Apollo/LinkedIn | Email sequences, enrichment |
| PhantomBuster | LinkedIn automation |
| Slack | Notifications |
| Zapier | Automations |
| Typeform | Forms/interviews |
| Yesware | Email engagement |
| Stripe | Invoicing & Payments |

### With HirePilot
All of the above become native features.

## Core Terminology
- **Lead**: A potential client or candidate.
- **Candidate**: Someone being considered for a role.
- **REQ**: A Job Requisition — the central “hiring project.”
- **Opportunity**: A business deal associated with a client.
- **Campaign**: An outreach sequence for email or LinkedIn.
- **Agent Mode**: REX performing automated or semi-automated tasks.
- **Credit**: A unit used for enrichment, messaging, or LinkedIn actions.

---

## What HirePilot Cannot Do (Important)
- Guarantee email deliverability on personal domains.
- Log into your LinkedIn account directly unless you authorize a remote session.
- Perform illegal or unsafe LinkedIn automation.
- Send mass emails beyond safety thresholds.
- Replace your professional judgment — it assists your workflow, not your ethics.

---

## Troubleshooting (Quick)
If HirePilot feels “confusing,” try answering:
- “What task am I trying to complete right now?”
- “Am I working with a **Lead**, a **Candidate**, or a **REQ**?”
- “Is this an **outreach**, **sourcing**, or **pipeline** action?”
- “Is this something REX can do automatically?”

If a user doesn’t know “where something happens,” route them:
- Outreach → **Campaigns**
- Recruiting → **Candidates or REQs**
- Client work → **Deals**
- Data → **Tables**
- Issues/errors → **Support or REX**
