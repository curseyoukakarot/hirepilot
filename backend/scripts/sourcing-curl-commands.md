## üß™ Complete Test Workflow

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Complete workflow test

# 1. Set environment
export API="http://localhost:8080"
export AUTH_TOKEN="your-token-here"

# 2. Create campaign
CAMPAIGN=$(curl -s -X POST $API/api/sourcing/campaigns \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"title":"Test Campaign","audience_tag":"Tech"}')

# 3. Extract campaign ID (requires jq)
CID=$(echo $CAMPAIGN | jq -r '.id')
echo "Created campaign: $CID"

# 4. Generate sequence
curl -X POST $API/api/sourcing/campaigns/$CID/sequence \

```

## üö® Important Notes

### Authentication
- Include `Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN` header if authentication is enabled
- Token should be a valid JWT with appropriate permissions

### Campaign IDs
- Replace `<CID>` with actual campaign UUID from create response
- Replace `<REPLY_ID>` and `<LEAD_ID>` with actual UUIDs from replies

### Email Sending
- **BE CAREFUL** with `/schedule` endpoint - it sends real emails!
- Test with internal email addresses first
- Ensure SendGrid is properly configured

### Error Handling
- Check HTTP status codes (200/201 = success, 400/500 = error)
- Parse JSON error messages for debugging
- Validate required fields before sending requests

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **401 Unauthorized** - Check AUTH_TOKEN
2. **404 Not Found** - Verify API endpoint and campaign ID
3. **400 Bad Request** - Check JSON syntax and required fields
4. **500 Internal Error** - Check server logs and database connection

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test API connectivity
curl -I $API/health

# Verbose output for debugging
curl -v -X GET $API/api/sourcing/campaigns

# Pretty print JSON responses
curl -s $API/api/sourcing/campaigns | jq '.'
```
