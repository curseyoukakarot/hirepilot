## üí¨ Conversation Examples

### Complete Campaign Creation Flow

```
User: "I want to create a sourcing campaign for hiring React developers"

REX: I'll help you create a sourcing campaign for React developers. Let me start by creating the campaign.

[Calls sourcing_create_campaign with title "React Developers Hiring Campaign"]

Great! I've created your campaign. Now let me generate a personalized 3-step email sequence for React developers.

[Calls sourcing_save_sequence with React-specific titles and tech industry context]

Perfect! I've generated a 3-step sequence. The emails will be spaced 2 business days apart. Would you like to add leads to this campaign now?

User: "Yes, I have a CSV with 100 React developer contacts"

REX: Excellent! Please upload your CSV and I'll process the leads and add them to your campaign.

[After CSV processing, calls sourcing_add_leads with the processed lead data]

I've successfully added 100 leads to your campaign. Everything is ready to launch. Would you like me to start the campaign now?

User: "Yes, launch it!"

REX: [Calls sourcing_schedule_sends]

üöÄ Your React Developers campaign is now live! The first emails will be sent immediately, with follow-ups scheduled for 2 and 4 business days later. You'll receive notifications when leads reply.
```

### Campaign Management

```
User: "How are my sourcing campaigns performing?"

REX: [Calls sourcing_list_campaigns]

You have 3 active sourcing campaigns:

1. **React Developers Campaign** - Running
   - 100 leads, 45 emails sent
   - 8 positive replies, 2 meetings booked

2. **Backend Engineers Outreach** - Running  
   - 75 leads, 30 emails sent
   - 5 positive replies, 1 meeting booked

3. **DevOps Specialists** - Completed
   - 50 leads, all emails sent
   - 12 positive replies, 4 meetings booked

Would you like detailed information about any specific campaign?
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Authentication & Security
- All tools require premium user access (`assertPremium()`)
- API calls use `AGENTS_API_TOKEN` for authentication
- User context automatically included in all requests
- Input validation via Zod schemas

### API Integration
- Tools make HTTP requests to backend API endpoints
- Responses are parsed and returned to REX
- Error handling with descriptive messages
- Automatic retry logic for failed requests

### MCP Server Configuration
```typescript
// REX MCP server registration
server.registerCapabilities({
  tools: {
    sourcing_create_campaign: { /* tool definition */ },
    sourcing_save_sequence: { /* tool definition */ },
    // ... other tools
  }
});
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Environment Variables
```bash
BACKEND_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
AGENTS_API_TOKEN=your-jwt-token-here
```

### Starting REX Server
```bash
# Start the REX MCP server
npm run rex:server

# Test sourcing tools
npm run test:rex-sourcing
```

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Campaign Metrics
REX can provide real-time campaign analytics:
- Total leads processed
- Emails sent/scheduled
- Reply rates and classifications
- Meeting bookings
