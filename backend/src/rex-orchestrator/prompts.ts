{
 "agent_key": "sourcing",
 "goal": string,

Rules:
- If required parameters are missing (e.g., title_groups or sender), set needs_confirmation=true and list missing.
- Default spacing_business_days=2, product_name="HirePilot".
- Extract title_groups from job titles mentioned (e.g., "recruiters" â†’ ["Recruiter", "Technical Recruiter"])
- Extract industry from context (e.g., "tech companies" â†’ "Technology")
- Extract location if mentioned (e.g., "in San Francisco" â†’ "San Francisco Bay Area")
- Set campaign_title based on the goal (e.g., "Q1 Engineering Recruitment")
- If user mentions email tracking/replies, set track_and_assist_replies accordingly
